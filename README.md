# 100% Accurate Melee Marth 

*Developed with Smashline 2*

This is exactly how broken we all remember him being in Melee.

This is my very first mod, so please do not hold back. Good, critical feedback is 
invaluable for future mod development.

## Modifications

### Grab

- Extended Marth's base grab range to it's Melee "equivalent". 
- Gave Marth a comeback mechanic where grab length scales with damage taken. Once at 100%, 
the grab stops scaling.

### Fsmash

- Increased Tipper range

### Jab

- Jab 1 is now cancellable into any move.

### Aerials

- DAir, FAir, and UAir can be cancelled much earlier, buffing Marth's air game. 

#### UAir 

- Extended the hitbox so Marth can hit behind him, sort of like Sephiroth's UAir.

#### FAir 

- Tipper gives hit stun of 1.65 times. 
- Tipper sends at an angle of 67 degrees, optimal Ken Combo angle.

#### DAir 

- Made spike for the ken combo easier to hit. 
- Increased tipper size

#### Bair

- Increased Tipper size

### Side Special

- "He flies through the air with the greatest of ease"
- Gives Marth a horizontal and veritcal boost when using move 1 in the air. 
- Cancellable move 1, so you can better enable combos.

### Up Throw

- Decreased base knockback to better enable combos.
- Increased Knockback growth to throw opponents to the moon.

### Down Throw
- Knockback angle greatly reduced to trip up opponents.


## Ideas for Future Work

1) If holding the A button after landing a tipper forward air, teleport above the 
opponent and automatically do the Ken Combo.
2) Increase the size of Marth's sword to that of Ike's, and extend the hitboxes.
3) Replace all of his movement sounds with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAj-QrxINPg
4) Chargeable grab (no idea if this is even possible) to make Marth's grab box taller / longer.
5) (Almost) Every sword hitbox is tipper.
