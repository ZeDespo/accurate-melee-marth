# 100% Accurate Melee Marth 

This is exactly how broken we all remember him being in Melee.

This is my very first mod, so please do not hold back. Good, critical feedback is 
invaluable for future mod development.

## Modifications

### Grab

- Extended Marth's base grab range to it's Melee "equivalent". 
- Gave Marth a comeback mechanic where grab length scales with damage taken. Once at 100%, 
the grab stops scaling.

### Aerials

- DAir, FAir, and UAir can be cancelled much earlier, buffing Marth's air game. 

#### UAir 

- Extended the hitbox so Marth can hit behind him, sort of like Sephiroth's UAir.

#### FAir 

- Tipper gives hit stun of 1.65 times. 
- Tipper sends at an angle of 67 degrees, optimal Ken Combo angle.

#### DAir 

- Made spike for the ken combo easier to hit. 

### Side Special

- "He flies through the air with the greatest of ease"
- Gives Marth a horizontal and veritcal boost when using move 1 in the air. 

### Up Throw

- Decreased base knockback to better enable combos.
- Increased Knockback growth to throw opponents to the moon.

### Down Throw
- Knockback angle greatly reduced to trip up opponents.
