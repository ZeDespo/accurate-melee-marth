# 100% Accurate Melee Marth 

*Developed with Smashline 2*

This is exactly how broken we all remember him being in Melee.

This is my very first mod, so please do not hold back on questions, comments, and 
critiques. Critical feedback is invaluable for not only this mod's development, but for
other mods I have in mind.

## Modifications

### Grab

- Extended Marth's base grab range to it's Melee "equivalent". 
- Gave Marth a comeback mechanic where grab length scales with damage taken. Once at 100%, 
the grab stops scaling.

### Fsmash

- Increased Tipper range
- Can now hit behind the opponent

### Jab

- Jab 1 is now cancellable into any move.
- Jab 1 has 1.7 more frames of hitstun.


### NAir

- Better tipper
- Cancellable on frame 35

### UAir 

- Extended the hitbox so Marth can hit behind him, sort of like Sephiroth's UAir.
- Cancellable on frame 20

#### FAir 

- Tipper has 1.65 more frames of hitstun. 
- Tipper sends at an angle of 67 degrees, optimal Ken Combo angle.
- Cancellable on frame 24

#### DAir 

- Tipper a bit larger
- Used Melee's down air animation (sword swing starts from direction marth faces)
- Cancellable on frame 30 

#### Bair

- Increased Tipper size.
- Cancallable on frame 29.

### Side Special

- "He flies through the air with the greatest of ease"
- Gives Marth a horizontal and veritcal boost when using move 1 in the air. 
- Cancellable move 1, so you can better enable combos.

### Up Special

- Jigglypuff vs Roy matchup feels
- Reverse hitbox with a base knockback of 130.

### Up Throw

- Decreased base knockback to better enable combos.
- Increased Knockback growth to throw opponents to the moon.

### Down Throw
- Knockback angle set to 135 for evil chain grabs.


## Ideas for Future Work

1) If holding the A button after landing a tipper forward air, teleport above the 
opponent and automatically do the Ken Combo.
2) Increase the size of Marth's sword to that of Ike's, and extend the hitboxes.
3) Replace all of his movement sounds with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAj-QrxINPg
4) Chargeable grab (no idea if this is even possible) to make Marth's grab box taller / longer.
5) (Almost) Every sword hitbox is tipper.
